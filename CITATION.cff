title: 'edgeTransport: Prepare EDGE Transport Data for the REMIND model'
version: 1.1.1
date-released: '2023-10-09'
abstract: EDGE-T is a fork of the GCAM transport module https://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/energy.html#transportation
  with a high level of detail in its representation of technological and modal options.
  It is a partial equilibrium model with a nested multinomial logit structure and
  relies on the modified logit formulation. Most of the sources are not publicly available.
  PIK-internal users can find the sources in the distributed file system in the folder
  `/p/projects/rd3mod/inputdata/sources/EDGE-Transport-Standalone`.
