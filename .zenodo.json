  "description": "<p>EDGE-T is a fork of the GCAM transport module https://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/energy.html#transportation with a high level of detail in its representation of technological and modal options. It is a partial equilibrium model with a nested multinomial logit structure and relies on the modified logit formulation. Most of the sources are not publicly available. PIK-internal users can find the sources in the distributed file system in the folder `/p/projects/rd3mod/inputdata/sources/EDGE-Transport-Standalone`.<\/p>",
